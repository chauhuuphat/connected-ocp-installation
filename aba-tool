aba-tool với môi trường connected 
Lab guide offical: https://github.com/sjbylo/aba

Kiểm tra các thông tin về môi trường:

1. Bastion (4vCPU/8GB RAM, DISK 200GB)
2. vmware resources hoặc bare-metal resource (cpu, ram, nic: mac-address) 
Lưu ý: SNO openshift cluster min 8vCPU, 16 GB RAM. 

Kiểm tra các gói cài đặt trên Bastion:

- Clone or download this Git repository (https://github.com/sjbylo/aba.git) to any location in your home directory.
- Download and store the Red Hat registry pull secret to ~/.pull-secret.json (a pull secret can be downloaded from https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret).
- Install required RPMs listed in templates/rpms-external.txt (or, if dnf is configured, let Aba use dnf to install the packages).
- Run sudo dnf update to ensure all packages are up to date (optional).
- Password-less sudo root access is recommended. (#sudo visudo)
Tips: 
## Allows people in group wheel to run all commands
#%wheel ALL=(ALL)       ALL

## Same thing without a password
%wheel  ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL

- Aba has also been tested with root user.
